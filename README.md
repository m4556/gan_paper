###  Project Overview

A deep learning project that automatically generates colorized anime characters based on sketch drawings, using Conditional GANs. This is implementation of "Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks" from scratch.

### Demo
This section displays some outputs of the program. Each example contains an input image (left), a ground truth image (middle), and a generated image (right).



### Anime dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: [link.](https://www.kaggle.com/ktaebum/anime-sketch-colorization-pair) and exctact to data folder.
